# Homebrew formula for the Dahrk edge client.
#
# This is the CANONICAL SOURCE for the formula. It is mirrored into the tap repo
# github.com/dahrkai/homebrew-tap as Formula/dahrk.rb, where `brew install dahrkai/tap/dahrk` reads
# it. The release workflow (.github/workflows/release.yml) rewrites `url`/`sha256` for the published
# version and pushes the update to the tap on every tagged release; keep this copy in step for the
# manual bootstrap of the very first release.
#
# The npm package is `dahrk-node`; the binary/command it installs is `dahrk`.
